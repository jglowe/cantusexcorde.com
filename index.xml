      <description>The backbone of chanting the hours is the Gregorian psalm tones.&#xA;There are 8 main Gregorian modes with a few more. CC watershead has excellent recording of what they sound like. Here is the page listing them: https://www.ccwatershed.org/2023/11/29/pdf-download-eight-gregorian-psalm-tones-harmonies-by-jeff-ostrowski/&#xA;The mode you use is determined by the antiphon you say. There are multiple sources for antiphons in Latin in the OF. The antiphonale Romanum 1 and 2 contain the antiphons for lauds and vespers for Sundays and solemnities.</description>

      <description>What are the &amp;ldquo;Hours&amp;rdquo; of the Liturgy of the Hours? The &amp;ldquo;Hours&amp;rdquo; referred to here are the prayers said a specific parts of the day and not the length of time it takes. The Church has set 7 times of the day aside to pray. The precise times aren&amp;rsquo;t super strict and you can pray each hour in the general time of day that the name suggests. These are the names and approximate times of the hours.</description>

      <description>It seems like something priests and religious would do. But surely it isn&amp;rsquo;t something for lay people? In fact yes lay people are encouraged to pray it.</description>
